items.DEUTERIUM_SYNTHESIZER.name=Deuterium Synthesizer
items.DEUTERIUM_SYNTHESIZER.description=The Deuterium Synthesizer is used to produce deuterium. Synthesizers are built in huge extracting platforms under the sea. As deuterium weighs more than double that of a single hydrogen atom, it can be found combined with oxygen in the deeper levels of the sea, due to its bigger molecular weight. Synthesizers extract and refine this water, providing usable Deuterium.
items.SOLAR_PLANT.name=Solar Plant
items.SOLAR_PLANT.description=A Solar Plant is a building used to generate energy to power your Metal Mine, Crystal Mine, and Deuterium Synthesizer.
items.FUSION_REACTOR.name=Fusion Reactor
items.FUSION_REACTOR.description=Fusion Reactors are buildings used for the conversion of the mined resource deuterium into energy. Fusion Reactors are especially effective at additional energy generation on colder planets, where Solar Satellites generate less energy and Deuterium Synthesizers generate more deuterium.
items.ROBOTICS_FACTORY.name=Robotics Factory
items.ROBOTICS_FACTORY.description=Robotics Factories reduce the time taken to construct buildings but not research times nor that of defensive structures. The base time required for construction is divided by (1 + level of Robotics Factory).
items.NANITE_FACTORY.name=Nanite Factory
items.NANITE_FACTORY.description=Nanite Factory produces nano-sized robots, which are considered the ultimate achievement in Robotic technology. These are capable of greatly increasing construction speed of buildings, defenses and ships. In game terms, the Nanite Factory halves the construction time for all buildings, ships, and defense cumulatively for every level that is upgraded. In addition levels 5 and 10 will grant passive ship production.
items.SHIPYARD.name=Shipyard
items.SHIPYARD.description=The Shipyard is responsible for constructing all ships and defensive structures. The level of the Shipyard and the Nanite Factory have an effect on the build times of ships and defense. In addition, levels 6, 9, and 12 will grant passive ship production.
items.METAL_STORAGE.name=Metal Storage
items.METAL_STORAGE.description=Metal Storage structures provide huge storage containment for raw unprocessed metal from metal mines. The higher the level, the more metal can be held. Once the capacity is used up, no more metal can be harvested by the metal mines.
items.CRYSTAL_STORAGE.name=Crystal Storage
items.CRYSTAL_STORAGE.description=Crystal Storage is a facility that stores unprocessed crystals from your mines. Once the capacity is used up, no more crystal may be harvested by the crystal mines.
items.DEUTERIUM_TANK.name=Deuterium Tank
items.DEUTERIUM_TANK.description=The Deuterium Tank stores unused Deuterium.
items.RESEARCH_LAB.name=Research Lab
items.RESEARCH_LAB.description=The Research Lab allows you to conduct Research. Each level of the Research Lab allows faster researching times.
items.TERRAFORMER.name=Terraformer
items.TERRAFORMER.description=The Terraformer is a building that increases the fields on your planet so that you can build more structures when your planet is full. For each level of terraformer, you get 7 additional empty fields to use.
items.ALLIANCE_DEPOT.name=Alliance Depot
items.ALLIANCE_DEPOT.description=An Alliance Depot is where a friendly fleet can be re-fueled with your deuterium, allowing them to remain at your planet.The Alliance Depot also enables your alliance to communicate their activities better, resulting in each alliance member with a Depot receiving passive resources from combat missions of members of your alliance.
items.LUNAR_BASE.name=Lunar Base
items.LUNAR_BASE.description=Lunar bases are structures similar to Terraformer constructed on a moon that generate three lunar fields per level, allowing for the building of structures, such as Jump Gates and Sensor Phalanxes. Unlike terraformer, they must be constructed in order to build more structures. It is important to note that upgrading your lunar base requires an open field. Additionally, each level of the lunar base increases the resource you gain from Sensor Phalanx.
items.SENSOR_PHALANX.name=Sensor Phalanx
items.SENSOR_PHALANX.description=The Sensor Phalanx, only buildable on a moon, is one of the most useful buildings in the game. Using the Phalanx you can scan a planet for 5,000 deuterium. Fleets in flight towards the planet will be shown, together with their composition of ships and time of arrival (note that you don't see resources that fleets are carrying). This structure also enables you to identify and passivly harvist debris from across the universe.
items.JUMP_GATE.name=Jump Gate
items.JUMP_GATE.description=Jump Gates can only be built on Moons. If you have more than one moon and a Jump Gate on each you can transport your entire fleet, but no resources, instantly from one to the other without using deuterium. Constructing/owning only a single jump gate has no benefit, since a source and destination jump gate are required to operate.
items.MISSILE_SILO.name=Missile Silo
items.MISSILE_SILO.description=A Missile Silo is a building that launches and stores missiles. A Level 2 Missile Silo is required to be able to build Anti-ballistic Missiles and a Level 4 Missile Silo is needed to start building Interplanetary Missiles. For each level of the missile silo an extra 10 slots are made available. An anti-ballistic missile occupies 1 slot, while an interplanetary missile occupies 2.

items.GRAVITON_TECHNOLOGY.name=Graviton Technology
items.GRAVITON_TECHNOLOGY.description=Graviton Technology is the pinnacle of technological research. With a staggering cost of 300,000 Energy, only strong (or very cunning) players belonging to successful alliances can afford to research it. The higher Graviton Technology you have, the better player you are.
# Units
items.SMALL_CARGO.name=Small Cargo
items.SMALL_CARGO.abbreviation=SC
items.SMALL_CARGO.description=At the beginning, this spacecraft is the basic unit for resource transport. Although it has no armor and moves slowly, it can carry 5000 resource units at once. The small transporter is the first ship which makes it worth your while to raid neighbors with. You should never send it out without an escort. It can be shot down by a single Rocket Launcher and can result in a standoff with only 5 Solar Satellites or espionage probe, since it cannot destroy them at all.
items.LARGE_CARGO.name=Large Cargo
items.LARGE_CARGO.abbreviation=LC
items.LARGE_CARGO.description=The Large Cargo Ship is one of the most used ships, along with Battleships, Little Fighters and Recyclers. The large cargo capacity of 25,000 makes it essential for raiding efficiency.
items.LITTLE_FIGHTER.name=Little Fighter
items.LITTLE_FIGHTER.abbreviation=LF
items.LITTLE_FIGHTER.description=Given their relatively low armor and simple weapons systems, little fighters serve best as support ships in battle. Their agility and speed, paired with the number in which they often appear, can provide a shield-like buffer for bigger ships that are not quite as maneuverable.
items.HEAVY_FIGHTER.name=Heavy Fighter
items.HEAVY_FIGHTER.abbreviation=HF
items.HEAVY_FIGHTER.description=The Heavy Fighter is a more powerful version of the Little Fighter. Although the Heavy Fighter is more powerful than the Light Fighter, it isn't used as much as the light fighter because of the high Crystal to Metal ratio compared to the Little Fighter. Even though it is not as effective as the more powerful Cruiser, the Heavy Fighter can still cause a reasonable amount of damage when launched in significant numbers.
items.CRUISER.name=Cruiser
items.CRUISER.abbreviation=CR
items.CRUISER.description=With their rapid fire capabilities, cruisers are extremely effective at eliminating the Little Fighter and Rocket Launcher fodder. In addition, they are excellent as fast strike ships, especially if their Impulse Drive have been upgraded to a reasonable level. This can be especially useful if you're trying to intercept a returning fleet that has been spotted on a Sensor Phalanx.
items.BATTLESHIP.name=Battleship
items.BATTLESHIP.abbreviation=BS
items.BATTLESHIP.description=Battleships are the backbone of any military fleet. Heavy armor, powerful weapon systems, and a high cruising speed, in addition to a large cargo bay, combine to make this ship a tough opponent to fight against. Battleships are undeniably the most commonly used ship in the game, due to their high speed and power.

items.SOLAR_SATELLITE.abbreviation=SS
items.SOLAR_SATELLITE.description=Solar Satellites generate power for your planet but can be easily destroyed in an attack. Despite being a ship, it cannot be moved from the planet it was built on. The power generated depends on the average temperature of the planet and is therefore generally more useful on planets closer to the sun (i.e. at positions with lower numbers).
items.DESTROYER.name=Destroyer
items.DESTROYER.abbreviation=D
items.DESTROYER.description=True to their name, Destroyers are the largest and most powerful ships, second only to the Death Star. They are relatively slow, and require a lot of deuterium to move. Destroyers are sometimes used in large numbers in conjunction with Bombers and Battle Ships to crush turtles.
items.DEATH_STAR.name=Death Star
items.DEATH_STAR.abbreviation=DS
items.DEATH_STAR.description=The Death Star is the most advanced ship in the game. Graviton Technology must be researched as a requirement for the Death Star. It has the highest weapon power, shield strength, and structural integrity in the game. The Death Star can destroy Moons. It is the most powerful, expensive, and slowest ship in the game. Some consider the Death Star to be the ultimate achievement in the universe.
items.ROCKET_LAUNCHER.name=Rocket Launcher
items.ROCKET_LAUNCHER.abbreviation=RL

items.LIGHT_LASER.abbreviation=LL
items.LIGHT_LASER.description=The Light Laser is the second Defensive Structure that most players can build.

Light Lasers also have a higher weapon power than Rocket Launchers.
items.HEAVY_LASER.name=Heavy Laser
items.HEAVY_LASER.abbreviation=HL
items.HEAVY_LASER.description=The Heavy Laser is a defensive structure which becomes more useful towards the later end of the game. It is an improvement in sheer power over the Light Laser. However, it has less overall power-per-resource and similar things have Rapid Fire against it, making it much less used.
items.GAIUS_CANNON.name=Gaius Cannon
items.GAIUS_CANNON.abbreviation=GC
items.GAIUS_CANNON.description=The Gaius Cannon is a good defense against enemy ships. It is often compared to the Plasma Turret as an attractive endgame defense.

It deals noticeably less damage per round to powerful capital ships, but is more effective than Plasma Turrets at taking out fodder, because you can build more of them.
items.ION_CANNON.name=Ion Cannon
items.ION_CANNON.abbreviation=IC
items.ION_CANNON.description=The Ion Cannon is a defensive structure, well known for its relatively high Shield Power. It can be useful to build as fodder when you have excess crystal, as it is the only defense which costs more crystal than metal.
items.PLASMA_TURRET.name=Plasma Turret
items.PLASMA_TURRET.abbreviation=PT
items.PLASMA_TURRET.description=The Plasma Turret is the most powerful defense in the game. It is fairly expensive, but well worth its price. There is no ship with rapid fire against the Plasma Turret.

items.LARGE_SHIELD_DOME.name=Large Shield Dome
items.LARGE_SHIELD_DOME.abbreviation=LSD
items.LARGE_SHIELD_DOME.description=The Large Shield Dome is a stronger version of the Small Shield Dome. It costs 5 times the resources and has 5 times the Shield Power. Only one Large Shield Dome and one Small Shield Dome may be built on a planet.
items.ANTI_BALLISTIC_MISSILE.name=Anti-ballistic Missile
items.ANTI_BALLISTIC_MISSILE.description=Anti-Ballistic Missiles are launched automatically whenever an approaching Interplanetary Missile is detected. Otherwise, they do not take part in any attacks, thus they can not be sent on missions or destroyed by an attacking fleet.
